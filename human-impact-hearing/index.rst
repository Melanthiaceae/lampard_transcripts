Human impact hearings
=====================

“Between February and May 2022 the Inquiry held public hearings in England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, hearing evidence from more than 70
people, including affected subpostmasters, subpostmistresses, managers or
assistants, about the impact the failings surrounding the Horizon system have
had on their lives and the lives of their families and others. The Inquiry also
held virtual Focus Groups to learn more about these impacts. To date the
Inquiry has gathered information about the human cost from almost 200 affected
people.”
